This is the source code to my personal website. I write short essays and make static web pages using the Dreamweaver template, "Template/template.dwt". These pages are placed in writeups/ .

MakeContents.java is a single-class program that scans the writeups directory for web pages and automatically generates a table of contents with date and title, sorted by date of writing.
