    <p>Ever since the dosage on my antidepressants increased, I’ve been having vivid nightmares. During the day, the
        antidepressants allow me to function perfectly fine but it seems that the worst of my demons emerge at night to
        haunt me in my sleep. </p>
    <p>If I had to compare my nightmares a work of fiction, they would be closer to a Greek tragedy than they are to
        horror film. My dreams don’t have serial killers and spiders or monsters. They’re about completely rational
        things like failing classes, abandonment by loved ones, and having my life ruined. </p>
    <p>These nightmares conclude with me waking up with cold sweat and feelings of dread. My heart races and my mind
        wanders to all he negative things that could await me should I leave the safety of my bed. I lay there for
        hours. </p>
    <p>Once I do get up though, my days are mostly stress-free. I don’t spend nearly as much time worrying about things
        during my waking hours as I did before the medication. Throughout the day, I am mostly able to function and take
        steps to improve my life and I <i>am</i> truly grateful for that. Perhaps you could say the meds are
        front-loading anxiety so that I do all my worrying at once in the nighttime. <i>Maybe</i> it’s better this way.
