    <p>One of the the reasons for which the the Unabomber, Ted Kaczinsky was caught was his unusual usage of a common phrase: "You can't have your cake and eat it too."</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/jan/11/20060111-094446-5919r/">James R. Fitzgerald, acting unit chief in the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit-1 who has been with the agency for almost 20 years, recalls how a transposition of verbs in the manifesto written by the Unabomber helped lead to a closer identification of Ted Kaczynski in April 1996.<br/><br/>
The latter used the phrase “You can’t eat your cake and have it, too,” instead of the usual form, which is “You can’t have your cake and eat it, too.” Like most people, Mr. Fitzgerald thought Kaczynski had made a mistake. But examination of other letters by him contained a similar feature, which, Mr. Fitzgerald says, “is actually a traditionally middle English way of using the term. He technically had it right and the rest of us had it wrong. It was one of the big clues that allowed us to make the rest of the comparison and submit a report to the judge who signed off on a search warrant.”</blockquote><cite><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/jan/11/20060111-094446-5919r/">- The Washington Times 2006</a></cite>
    <p>Well I'm here to tell you that the unabomber is correct. The phrase should be "You can't eat your cake and have it too." It just doesn't make sense the other way around. <i>Of course</i> I can have my cake and eat it. That's how most people eat cake: you know, by having it first.</p>
