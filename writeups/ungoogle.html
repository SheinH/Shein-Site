		Do you ever feel as if a certain search engine company knows a little bit <em>too much</em> about you?
		I was laying in bed last night on my phone and I got into the rhythm of mindlessly watching one youtube video after	another and it just dawned on me exactly how much Google knew about me.

		Anyway, looking at this stream of videos it's pretty clear to me that Google has a thorough understanding of
		what I'm into. I would say that every single video on that feed is at least <em>somewhat</em> interesting to me. Now that statement might not mean much but think about it for a second:
		When's the last time you tuned into a TV channel and liked every show they had to
		offer? When's the last time you tuned into the radio and liked every song that came on?
		If that happened to you, that would be <em>pretty fucking creepy</em> wouldn't it?
