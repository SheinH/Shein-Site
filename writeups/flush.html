	<p>My happiest moments are when I think least, that I am sure of. Happiness is a simple state, the mind at tabula rasa. It is only through our walks through time and space that we gather our own stones to weigh down our mental existences and cloud our thoughts.</p>

<p>The path to happiness then is to let those things go. I mean come on. When it comes down to it, none of our biggest fears even really exist. I think of the past and my challenges up ahead and my own mental state but these are just figments invented by a mind all too skilled in abstraction, traveling through time to the future and past, exploring posibilities of what could and could've happen.</p>

	<p>However, the basest level I am a human who exists in a chair or a desk. I am typing at a laptop instead of paying attention to the screen in front of me. I am healthy and financially well. I will go home and eat adequate food and sleep. There is nobody around to harm me and I am safe. Now really how hard can things even go wrong?</p>
	<p>For this reason, I am creating this website. It will serve as a resting place for all the numerous thoughts that pop in and out of my mind. A flush lever.</p>
